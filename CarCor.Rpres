Correlated Variables
========================================================

Variable correlation is important in inferance and predictions:

- To better understand the data and gain intuition
- For identifying counfounding variables
- For feature reduction


Motor Trend Car Road Tests Data Set
========================================================

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

The data contains 32 observations on 11 variables.  Many of the variables are correlated...

Correlated Variables
========================================================

```{r echo=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor(mtcars), type="lower", order="hclust", tl.cex = 0.6, tl.col="black", tl.srt = 50)
```

Introducing Motor Trend Correlation Matrix
========================================================
The Motor Trend Correlation Matrix app lets you easily explore correlation between variables.  For example mpg and cylinders:
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
data(mtcars)
chart.Correlation(mtcars[, c("mpg","cyl")])
```
